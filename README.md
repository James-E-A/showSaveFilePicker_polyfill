# Usage

## Streamlined

Copy *only* `showSaveFilePicker.mjs` into your source tree, then import it as:

```js
import showSaveFilePicker from "./showSaveFilePicker.mjs?helperURL=https%3A%2F%2Fjames-e-a.github.io%2FshowSaveFilePicker_polyfill%2Fhelper.html";
```

## Simple

```js
import showSaveFilePicker from "https://james-e-a.github.io/showSaveFilePicker_polyfill/showSaveFilePicker.mjs";
```

## Advanced

[WIP] Beware, this may conflict with serviceworkers you have already installed:

```js
import showSaveFilePicker from "./showSaveFilePicker.mjs";
```
